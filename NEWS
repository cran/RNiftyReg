Significant changes to the RNiftyReg package are laid out below for each release.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.3.0

- 2D-to-2D, 3D-to-2D and 4D-to-3D registration are now supported by niftyreg().
  As a result of this added flexibility, a list of affine matrices, rather than
  a single matrix, is now returned by this function.
- An image of fewer than 4 pixels/voxels in any dimension cannot be registered
  since it cannot accommodate a single matching block. Providing such an image
  as the source or target now produces an error rather than a crash. (Thanks to
  Takeo Katsuki for pointing this out.)
- Further documentation improvements.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- Added an option to niftyreg() to control the type of interpolation that is
  applied to the final coregistered image.
- Performing better type checking of image data before passing it to the C++
  code, to avoid intermittent errors from R.
- Documentation improvements.

=================================================================================

VERSION 0.1.0

- First public release. 3D affine and rigid-body registration are available.
